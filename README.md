### 2. Advanced CSS: Portfolio

Makeing our own portfolio from the scratch. 


### Motivation

By learning the concept of the HTML and CSS with different syntax and structures we can use on layout the page. By wiritng the website from scratch is only possible if fully understand the skills you can use. Also gaining experience when wiritng your own code to learn when seeing the weird part to determine which part might be the error coming from. This is a useful experience to set up for future protfolio making.

HTML and CSS


### Summary

I make my own website and layout by using HTML and CSS. Because of my complicated framing when I come to media queries I get into bunch of problems that I have no idea how that happens. Its was a great experience by knowing and solving these problem so next time I wont be struggle as much as this time. Beyong the requirements I also try to make two HTML and link them together instead of only guiding to section.
